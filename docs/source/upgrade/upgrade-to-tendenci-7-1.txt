Upgrading from 7.0.x to 7.1.x
=============================

## DRAFT FOR WHEN TENDENCI 7.1 GETS PUSHED TO MASTER ##

Warning: this is a transitional upgrade that moves back to pulling from master from all repos or pypi. 

Step 1: Back up your site and database
--------------------------------------

If you're using docker, backup your docker container:
::

docker commit <site_name> backup/<site_name>:<your tag>

Uninstall the following modules from your virtualenv or your server.
::

    pip uninstall tendenci-case-studies
    pip uninstall tendenci-committees
    pip uninstall tendenci-donations
    pip uninstall tendenci-speakers
    pip uninstall tendenci-staff
    pip uninstall tendenci-studygroups
    pip uninstall tendenci-videos

Step 3: Update some files
-------------------------

These 2 files need to be manually updated:

    conf/local_settings.py
    conf/local_urls.py

In "conf/local_settings.py" add the following

     'tendenci.apps.committees',
     'tendenci.apps.case_studies',
     'tendenci.apps.donations',
     'tendenci.apps.speakers',
     'tendenci.apps.staff',
     'tendenci.apps.studygroups',
     'tendenci.apps.videos',
     'tendenci.apps.testimonials',

in conf/local_urls.py

    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.committees.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.case_studies.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.donations.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.speakers.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.staff.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.studygroups.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.videos.urls')),
    ('^', include('tendenci.apps.testimonials.urls')),

One new file needs to be added

    requirements/tendenci.txt

IMPORTANT: All future upgrades will completely overwrite the contents of this file with the latest version from the tendenci repo version of "tendenci.txt". Think of it as a "tendenci specific version of common.txt" - but we don't want to overwrite common.txt so we don't break other developers modifications. This is a compromise. The master file lives in the tendenci core project 

    /tendenci/templates/requirements/tendenci.txt

Yes, the project specific requirements/tendenci.txt file is not consistent with django standard naming conventions. Given the choice, we are choosing to respect the developers out there and not risk overwriting someone else's common.txt file.

Required: update requirements.txt in the root of your project to include the new tendenci.txt file.

Edit the file located (probably) at

    /var/www/tendenci/requirements.txt

or possibly at

    /opt/webapps/orgs/tendenci_site/requirements.txt

Add one line to point to the new file in the "requirements" directory

    -r requirements/tendenci.txt

REQUIRED: Edit the your common file to remove redundancies with the new tendenci.txt file if you are doing an upgrade

    requirements/common.txt
